# Welcome ðŸ¥³

This is my new mind garden! ðŸŒ¿

I love the framing of a [mind garden](https://nesslabs.com/mind-garden):

> taking care of your mind involves cultivating your curiosity (the seeds), growing your knowledge (the trees), and producing new thoughts (the fruits)

_(This site is more accurately perhaps a digital garden manifestation of my mind garden, but I don't like the word "digital" being so prominent)_

That's it for now.
