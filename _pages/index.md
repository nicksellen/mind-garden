# Welcome ðŸ¥³

This is my new mind garden! ðŸŒ¿

I love the framing of a [mind garden](https://nesslabs.com/mind-garden):

> taking care of your mind involves cultivating your curiosity (the seeds), growing your knowledge (the trees), and producing new thoughts (the fruits)

I might change/extend the metaphor a little though:
- seeds need soil to grow in, which needs it's own tending to
- we might bring many things to "fruition", not just new thoughts, might be more tangible/material things too
- all of this exists in collective space too, we interact with the insects, other trees, etc...
- we aren't just taking care of our _mind_ but our soul, our body, and others too

_(This site is more accurately perhaps a digital garden manifestation of my mind garden, but I don't like the word "digital" being so prominent)_

That's it for now.
