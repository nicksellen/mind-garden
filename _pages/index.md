# Welcome 🥳

This is my new [mind garden](https://nesslabs.com/mind-garden)! [^1] 🌿

> taking care of your mind involves cultivating your curiosity (🌱 the seeds), growing your knowledge (🌳 the trees), and producing new thoughts (🍎 the fruits)

I might extend this a little though:
- seeds need soil to grow in, which needs it's own tending too
- we might bring many things to fruition, not just new thoughts, might be more tangible/material things too
- all of this exists in collective space too, we interact with the insects, other trees, etc...
- we aren't just taking care of our _mind_ but our soul, our body, and others too

That's it for now.

[^1]: more usually called a digital garden, but I don't want the word _digital_ so prominent
